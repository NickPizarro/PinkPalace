    <string name="title_cultural">cultural</string>
    <string name="culturalDescription">The First Americans, butcher marks on a mastodon bone tell of a successful Paleolithic hunt. An extraordinary collection of finely crafted tools and Native American pottery are remnants of a complex civilization on the Mississippi. Mystical hunchback figures, grim disembodied human heads, and whimsical animal effigies, all carefully buried with the dead, reflect the spiritual beliefs of this mysterious culture.  The History of Memphis, 1800-1900 tells the story of Memphis from its birth as a frontier river town to its emergence as a vital Victorian Era city. Slavery and emancipation, disease and medicine, privilege and persecution are all brought to life through objects of both everyday life and extraordinary events. See Memphis housing from a reconstructed frontier cabin to an opulent Victorian music room  An horrific battle diorama forms the centerpiece of the Civil War gallery.  Thomas Harwell’s “mummy casket,” in its darkened alcove, represents an archeological mystery solved, while a mail coach, private buggy and public omnibus evoke the era of horse-drawn transportation.</string>

    <string name="naturalDescription">The first floor of the museum describes the natural history of the Mid-south.  This area, within a 200 mile area radius of Memphis, encompasses several major  environments including the channels and oxbow lakes of the Mississippi River  and its tributaries, their associated floodplains; the sand hills of western Tennessee  and northern Mississippi, and the nearby highlands of the Ouachita and Ozark  Mountains in Arkansas and the Highland Rim of Central Tennessee.   The exhibits open with “Adaptations”, a large collection of skulls and skeletons  of all types of animals. The display explains how the placement of teeth, horns  and antlers, and eyes as well as body shapes show how animals have evolved  to adapt to their environment.</string>
