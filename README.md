This project was created for educational purpose for Mobile Application Development.  This course was taken at the University of Memphis where there were no guidelines on how to create the app.  The app went through wireframe, prototype, and finally development. 

The purpose for the app is to provide faster access rather than going through a complex website.

The application was developed from scratch by Nicolas Pizarro.

App is currently in development
